## Project Description

This project aims to explain the basic concepts and logic of Relationship Rule Analysis. It also provides an example of how this analysis can be used in the field of data mining.

## Used technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn libraries

## Setup

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/UserName/AssociationRuleAnalysis.git`
2. Go to the project directory: `cd AssociationRuleAnalysis`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Use

1. Download the project files and install the required packages as needed.
2. Upload the data file or create sample data.
3. Run the Association Rule Analysis algorithm and examine the results.

## What is Relationship Rule Analysis?

Relationship Rule Analysis is a technique used in data mining. This technique aims to find interesting relationships between elements in a dataset. Specifically, it tries to come up with statements such as "If X, then Y happens."

## Algorithm and Logic

It can work with methods such as Relationship Rule Analysis algorithm, Apriori algorithm. It generates specific rules by examining the frequencies and relationships of the items in the data set. These rules can be used in applications such as grocery basket analysis, for example.

## Results and Evaluation

Details on the results of the project and how the Relationship Rule Analysis can be used will be included here.
